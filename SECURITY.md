# Security Policy

Ockam is in Developer Preview and in active development.

If you find a security problem or have any questions about the security of the protocols in Ockam,
we would love to hear them.

We do new releases of Ockam Rust Crates every week.

Please
[file an issue](https://github.com/ockam-network/ockam/issues) or
[start a discussion](https://github.com/ockam-network/ockam/discussions).
